### Strengths / Weaknesses of Digital Trace Data

**Strengths**
- Analyze events as they unfold
- Less social desirability bias---close to actual experience
- Capture social relationships

**Weaknesses**
- Many services are private
- Usually not representative of the US population
- People drift to new platforms
- Algorithms may return unintended results (e.g., Google Flu)
- Unstructured data---lots of cleaning necessary
- Ethical considerations---do users consent to sharing their data?
- Positive bias due to a desire to perform for others

Weakness of the [Reddit Dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I7cvuCBQxosQK2evTcdL3qtglaEPc0WFEs6rZMx-xiE/edit#gid=0)
1. Not representative 
2. New platforms emerging (e.g., Discord?)
3. Unstructured data with lots of images, links, headers, emojis, etc.

I downloaded an article by Bail (2015) that discusses how to use digital trace data with survey research---I want to do this! Digital traces of minority stress---textual features of minority stress---combined with survey data to achieve triangulation.
